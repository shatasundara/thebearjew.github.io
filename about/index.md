I'm a student at [Diablo Valley College](http://dvc.edu) working on 
transfering to UC Berkeley's undergraduate Computer Science program.

Most of my time is spent writing and learning Objective-C and iOS. I'm 
passionate about writing, programming, and properly roasted coffee... 
because you know, no one wants to drink motor oil.

I love attending hackathons. I've hacked at [CalHacks](http://calhacks.io), [HackJam](https://www.facebook.com/events/1569464466625216/), [
TreeHacks](http://treehacks.com), and recently [LAHacks](http://lahacks.
com). 

I'm currently looking for jobs or internships for summer 2015 and 
beyond. If you're interested in filling an entry level position, feel 
free to [reach out](mailto:{{ site.email }}) to me and checkout my [resume](../resume/resume.pdf)
