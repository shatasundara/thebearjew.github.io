I'm a student currently taking classes at [Diablo Valley College](http://dvc.edu) working on transfering to UC Berkeley's undergraduate Computer Science program.

Most of my time is spent writing and learning Objective-C and iOS. I'm passionate about writing, programming, and properly roasted coffee: because you know, no one wants to drink motor oil.


Feel free to reach out to me about anything and everything.
