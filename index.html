  <h3>Me</h3>
  <p>I'm a second&#8208;year Computer Science student at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diablo_Valley_College">Diablo Valley College</a> working on transfering to UC Berkeley. I love to make things with code! Right now I'm learning new languages, libraries, and frameworks (iOS/Web). I particularly enjoy JavaScript and Python right now, though I still love Objective&#8208;C and Swift.</p>

  <h3>dvcoders</h3>
  <p>Currently I am the president of DVC's first programming/hacker club &#8208; <a href="https://dvcoders.com">dvcoders</a>.</p>
  <p>At DVC I noticed a complete lack of knowledge of real&#8208;world programming practices&#58; no one knew how to use Git or Github at all! dvocders introduces students to new concepts and real world practices like RESTful APIs, JavaScript, and Git. We also support members in their side projects by coding and debugging with them.</p>
