# Hi, I'm Jacob

<br>

I'm a second-year Computer Science student at [Diablo Valley College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diablo_Valley_College) working on transfering to UC Berkeley. 

I love to make things with code. Right now I'm learning new languages, libraries, and frameworks (iOS/Web). I particularly enjoy JavaScript and Python, though I still love Objective-C and Swift.
