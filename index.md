# Hi, I'm Jacob

<br>

I'm a second-year Computer Science student at [Diablo Valley College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diablo_Valley_College) working on transfering to UC Berkeley. 

I love to make things with code! Right now I'm learning new languages, libraries, and frameworks (iOS/Web). I particularly enjoy JavaScript and Python, though I still love Objective-C and Swift.

### dvcoders

Currently I am the president of DVC's first programmer/hacker club - [dvcoders](https://dvcoders.com).

I noticed that nearly all CS students had a lack of knowledge of real-world programming practices. **No one knew how to use Git/Github at all!**

dvocders introduces students to new concepts and real world practices like RESTful APIs, JavaScript, and Git. We also support members in their side projects by coding and debugging with them.
