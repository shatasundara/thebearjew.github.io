I'm a second-year Computer Science student at [Diablo Valley College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diablo_Valley_College) working on transfering to UC Berkeley. I'm fascinated by Neural Networks, Natural Language Processing, and Data Science (when used for good, not evil). 

I enjoy writing about hackathons, Git/Github, JavaScript/Node, Computer Science, and software I use and love.

I won the first Hackathon I went to ([Hack Jam](http://hackjam.io) by [Hackers@Berkeley](http://hackersatberkeley.com)) by making the Chrome extension "[Squirtle](https://github.com/thebearjew/squritle)".

Recently I've had the great opportunity to be an **organizer** and **volunteer** for [Cal Hacks 2.0](http://calhacks.io) - the largest colligate hackathon ever - and this year's [Hack Jam](http://hackjam.io).

### dvcoders

I am the president of DVC's first programmer/hacker club - [dvcoders](https://dvcoders.com). Myself and others noticed that nearly all CS students had a lack of knowledge of real-world programming practices. **No one knew how to use Git/Github at all!**

dvocders introduces students to new concepts and real world practices like RESTful APIs, JavaScript, and Mobile Applications.
