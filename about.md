I'm an aspiring iOS and Web Developer currently working on my Computer Sceince degree. I'm fascinated by Neural Networks and Data Science (when used for good, not evil). 

You'll probably find me writing about things I like and learn: hackathons, Git/Github, JavaScript/Node, Computer Science, and products I use and love.

### Hackathons
I won the first Hackathon I went to (*[Hack Jam](http://hackjam.io)* by [Hackers@Berkeley](http://hackersatberkeley.com)) by making the Chrome extension "[Squirtle](https://github.com/thebearjew/squritle)".

Since then, I caught the hackathon bug. Recently I've had the great opportunity to be an organizer and volunteer for [Cal Hacks 2.0](http://calhacks.io) - the largest colligate hackathon ever - and this year's [Hack Jam](http://hackjam.io).

At Cal Hacks 2.0 I was a lead volunteer and ended up helping the amazing organizers halfway through the event. I helped with check-in, unloaded trucks of swag/food, helped sponsors setup, configure audio/video throughout California Memorial Stadium, and served/unloaded food.

### dvcoders

Currently I am the president of DVC's first programmer/hacker club - [dvcoders](https://dvcoders.com).

At DVC, we noticed that nearly all CS students had a lack of knowledge of real-world programming practices. **No one knew how to use Git/Github at all!**

dvocders introduces students to new concepts and real world practices like RESTful APIs, JavaScript, and Git. We also support members in their side projects by coding and debugging with them.
