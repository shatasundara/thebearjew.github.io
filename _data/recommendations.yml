        If you haven't read [Freakonomics](http://freakonomics.com/books/freakonomics/), the amazing, shocking, and eye-opening book on economics by Stephen Dubner and Stephen Levitt: **you should read it!**

        Dan Carlin hits your *history sweet spot*. Harcore History goes in depth into major events like World War I and long of history Mongol Conquest. Each episode is over 3 hours long, and rich in historical first-hand sources, historian/academic perspectives, and human stories - all with Dan Carlin's legendary narration.
        The depth, detail, and scrutity Dan goes into is outstanding and entirely worth listening to [I highly recommend [Wrath of the Khans part I](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/show-43-wrath-of-the-khans-i/id173001861?i=116854083&mt=2)).

        An all encompassing book which devels deeply into the history and applications of crytopgraphy through stories of prominent users and inventors of crytopgraphy. From Juliues Ceasar and the Romans, to Navajo Code Talkers, to Allan Turing and the Enigma. The book strikes the **perfect balance** between history/narrative, and perfect technical explanations for ciphers, codes, and algoriths. I firmly believe this book is equally valuable to the layman and [Whitfield Diffe and Matin Hellmen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffieâ€“Hellman_key_exchange).

        When Chistopher Columbus set foot on America, the contents had been separated for over 200 millions years. His quest to establish trade with China ended that split and set off the largest ecological and biological change the world has ever seen. Earthworms were never native to North America, and completely changed the landscape of all North America. An outstanding read on the "Columbian Exchange" and the long term effects of one greedy man.

    - name: A Brief History of NeoLiberalism
      author: David Harvey
      # image: neoliberalism.jpg
      description: >
        Neoliberlism as a philosophy holds that free markets, free trade, and the free flow of capital is the most efficient way to produce the greatest social, political, and economic good. It argues for reduced taxation, reduced regulation, and minimal government involvement in the economy. This includes the privitization of health and retirement benefits, the dismantling of trade unions, and the general opening up of the economy to foreign competition. Supporters of neoliberlism present this as an ideal system. Detractors, such as Harvey, see it as a power grab by economic elites and a race to the bottom for the rest.

        MacID unlocks your Mac by using awesome features like TouchID, tap gestures, and Bluetooth proximity. MacID allows you to do things like automatically sleep/wake your mac when you walk away from it, create trackpad gestures to quickly unlock your Mac, and send clipboard text between your iPhone and Mac. I find it incredibly useful and seamless to use.

        You might have seen me write about the importance of journaling. I journal every day, and Day One is the journaling app for iPhone and Mac.

For any journal entry you can attach things like pictures, physical activity, or songs. Give it a try, you'll find yourself wanting to journal more than before.

        I have tried literally **every single Markdown Editor there is**, none of them perfectly providing all of the features and syncing I need. iA writer finally does Markdown editing right! I uses an in-app "library" which syncs between iOS and OS X using iCloud. It has a perfectly simple UI and beautiful custom Markdown rendering. If all you need is an app you can open and start writing immediately, this is the app for you.
        Here are the other Markdown editors I've tried, used, and enjoyed: [MacDown - OSX](http://macdown.uranusjr.com), [Byword - iOS/OSX](http://bywordapp.com), [Editorial - iOS](http://omz-software.com/editorial/), and [TextNut - OSX](http://www.textnutwriter.com).

        Quiver is the programmer's notebook. Quiver uses "cells" to create notes, each cell can be either Rich Text, Markdown, or a Code Block (with hlighting for evey language). It's extremely useful when mixing documentation and code examples seamlessly. It has LaTex support, live preview, and a greate code editor. I've been using it to take notes in my Computer Science courses and I find it invaluable.
