        If you haven't read [Freakonomics](http://freakonomics.com/books/freakonomics/), the amazing, shocking, and eye-opening book on economics by Stephen Dubner and Stephen Levitt: **you should read it!**
        Freakonomics asks profound questions like: "Why do drug dealers still live with their moms?", "What do school teachers and sumo wrestlers have in common?", and "Where have all the criminals gone?"

        Dan Carlin hits your :history sweet spot". Harcore History goes in depth into major events (ex. WWI) and periods of history (ex. Genghis Khan Conquest). Each episode is over 3 hours long, and rich in historical first-hand sources, historian perspectives, and human stories throughout history - with the unique Dan Carlin narration.
        The depth, detail, and scrutity Dan goes into is **outstanding** and entirely worth listening to [I highly recommend [Wrath of the Khans part I](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/show-43-wrath-of-the-khans-i/id173001861?i=116854083&mt=2)).
