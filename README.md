My personal site, portfolio, and blog. Built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and deployed on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).

### About Me

I'm a student currently taking classes at [Diablo Valley College](http://dvc.edu) working on transfering to UC Berkeley's undergraduate Computer Science program.

Most of my time is spent writing and learning Objective-C and iOS. I'm passionate about writing, programming, and properly roasted coffee (because you know, no one wants to drink motor oil).


Feel free to reach out to me about anything and everything.
